<br><br>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This code implements the Dual-Tree Branch and Bound (BB) algorithm in [1] and efficiently optimizes the objective function of [3].
The algorithm combines ideas from the Dual Tree algorithm [5] and Efficient Subwindow Search (ESS) for detection [6]. The code also includes
some more recent extensions covered in [1a], including a tighter bounding scheme and the implementation of Cascade Detection (CD), along the lines of [7].
Branch-and-bound/Cascade detection are implemented in c++, and interface with Matlab through mex files. 
<br>
The current release also includes the lookup-based bounds presented in [1b], their incorporation with DTBB and Cascaded detection with DPMs, and also fixes some small inaccuracies at image boundaries. 
<br><br>

<h3>Software and licences</h3>
Our code builds on the system distributed in [4] under the GNU GPL. 
We include a slightly adapted version of that software, allowing us to extract timing information, and also to compile it in windows. 
We include parts of source code from the ESS implementation [6] and the Dual Tree implementation in [8], released under the Apache and the GNU GPL licences respectively. 
Our code is distributed under the GNU-gpl v2. 
<br><br>
<h3>Usage</h3>

Unzip the file and move into the formed directory.
The distribution comes with precomputed mex files for 64-bit windows, linux and mac systems. 
If you have a different architecture, run makefile_release.m

demo_0, demo_1, and demo_2 should run (please let me know if you encounter problems).
<br><br>
<h3>How to cite</h3>
We request that you cite [1] when using our code for your academic work. If you use some of the extensions in [1a], please cite appropriately. 
<br>
<br>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
Our contribution in [1] is an efficient optimization of the Mixture-of-DPM objective in [3], replacing the Generalized Distance Transform (GDT)-
based detection with Branch-and-Bound (BB). In [1a] we consider also Cascaded Detection, which turns out to be faster when using a fixed threshold.
Optimizing the score in [3] with GDTs scales linearly in image size, while the best-case complexity of BB is logarithmic.
<br><br>
In the evaluation we consider the following cases:<br>
demo_1: single object category detection <br>
demo_2: multi-category detection. <br>
<br>
Another feature of our code is that we provide an accurate, but more efficient implementation of unary potential computation
in `batch mode' using Matlab. Comparing to the convolution implementation of [2,3] this can result in an 5-8-fold speedup, while for multi-object detection
the speedup can be more than 10-fold. Multi-threaded computation comes for free through Matlab, but we don't use it in our evaluation for fairness' sake. <br> 
Please see demo_0 for details.
